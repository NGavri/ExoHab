# ExoHab
ExoHab is a machine-learning model designed to assess the habitability of exoplanets based on various planetary and stellar parameters. The algorithm analyzes features such as mass, radius, surface gravity, stellar flux, and temperature to predict the potential habitability of exoplanets, outputting a habitability score between 0 and 1.

Key Features:
Predicts habitability: Calculates a habitability score using supervised machine learning models.
Data-driven insights: Analyzes exoplanetary and stellar data to estimate the chances of a planet supporting life.
Scalable approach: The model can be expanded with additional features for enhanced accuracy.
Tools and Technologies:
Language: Python
Platform: Google Colab
Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas
This project aims to assist in exoplanet research by providing a reliable tool for habitability assessment, making it easier for researchers to prioritize which planets to study further.
